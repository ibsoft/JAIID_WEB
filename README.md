JAIID WEB - A Realtime [ Jovian Artificial Intelligence Impact Detector ]

JAIID WEB is a cutting-edge real-time Jovian impact detector designed to monitor the celestial giant, Jupiter, for the elusive phenomena of impact flashes. This sophisticated web-based platform leverages the power of artificial intelligence through advanced models to detect and analyze potential impact events on the gas giant. Developed with a passion for celestial observation and an eye on scientific discovery, JAIID WEB employs state-of-the-art AI models to scrutinize live data streams from backyard amateur telescopes pointed at Jupiter, by constantly monitoring the planet's surface for abrupt luminosity changes or distinct shape detection that may indicate celestial collisions. The platform serves as a testament to the synergy between astronomy and artificial intelligence, pushing the boundaries of what we can uncover in the vastness of our solar system.
